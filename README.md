# QHacks2022 - Friendzr
Team#25's submission for Queen's annual Hackathon.
I worked on the front-end and video-introduction part of the project.
 
#  Inspiration
Over the last year the world has been faced with an ever-growing pandemic. As a result, students have faced increased difficulty in finding new friends and networking for potential job offers. Based on Tinder’s UI and LinkedIn’s connect feature, we wanted to develop a web-application that would help students find new people to connect and network with in an accessible, familiar, and easy to use environment. Our hope is that people will be able Friendz to network successfully using our web-application.

#  What it Does
Friendzr allows users to login with their email or Google account and connect with other users. Users can record a video introduction of themselves for other users to see. When looking for connections, users can choose to connect or skip on someone’s profile. Selecting to connect allows the user to message the other party and network.
